# # WK1: CODE CHALLENGE
Prerequisite
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.
2. Use Javascript to wire down the solution.
3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
4. Submit the repository link for grading.
5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

### Running Tests

You understand how to read tests; now it's time to run the tests.

Recall that in the previous lesson, the tests were commented out. Be sure to **fork
and clone** this lab into your local environment so you have the version of the test
file that is not commented out. (Return to the previous lesson if you need a reminder
of how to do this.)

Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code. (If you are using a different text editor, the command
will be different.) Finally, run `npm install` to install the lab's
dependencies.

> What exactly do we mean by installing dependencies? Open the package.json file
> and scroll down to the bottom. You'll see a list of 'DevDependencies'. What's
> listed here are JavaScript packages: files or sets of files full of existing,
> reusable code. They are designed to be shared, allowing many developers to use
> the same code in their own projects. The packages you see listed in
> package.json make it possible to run the lab's tests. In order to use the
> packages, we have to install them; npm install does that for us.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges
# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
